The plus and minus buttons allow the user to zoom in and out. The figure can also be zoomed using pinch gestures or the scroll wheel. The figure can be panned using mouse or touch.

## Staring shape and seed
The drop down menus allow the user to change the starting shape (Start shape) and the figure replacing the lines in the starting shape (Seed). The reset button resets the figure to the starting shape.
